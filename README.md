# React JS GROK (unofficial) Example App

An unofficial React.js-based example project demonstrating real-world data fetching and processing through API integration. This repo focuses on core React concepts, including routing, UI transitions, component states, props, Redux, and cloud-based data interactions. Ideal for developers aiming to understand React.js complexity and its practical applications within scalable systems.

## App Outline

This is a simple app to show a basic react js app setup in meteor js with pages, react router between pages, some basic transitions and animations with a simple api integration for xAI Grok that you can talk to in the app ui. It also has some basic redux built in for app wide data managment as an example of using some of this stuff as an app shell.

The UI is simple and lightweight intentionally.. its to show the use and structure of pages, templates, sub templates, some icons and ui elements with various options, actions and transitions.

It is by no means a polished or well developed ui, this is intentional.. it's just a demo showpiece of app setup and code.

## High Level Design Concept(s)

The app is simple and lightweight, clean and ready to be adapted and grown as is.. this is to implement basic react js app structure for discussion, education or basic portfolio purposes.

## Design Principles & Choice Pathway(s)

The design principle was to craft a light, flat ui that's bright and simple as a starting point to build out functionally and add design swagger and "flavour(s)" to as and when / if needed.

There was initial experimentation with various routers and some testing of next js but for simplicity and times sake a smaller set of simpler libraries were used for app cohesion and fast development. It was written and put together in around two weeks as a quick demo of react js instead of using vue js for a similar task.

## UED, UXUI Approach & UI Basics

The UED (user expereince design) is highly rudimentary, in my professional opinion the best way to build is often for real not via mockup so its made to be functional and highly adaptable. The template nature of react js and vus js or simialr allows for iteration and growth of design while tracking changes and evolution with relatively simple design rollback if coded and designed well.

While complicated to do reliably and effectively in code, a "lego brick" type structure that allows for removal and exchange, especially early on is highly optimised for growth across teams or design style or within a single designer and/or developers scope. Allowing it to flex and grow as it needs to as and when necessary.

## React JS Principles & Complexity Abstraction Model

React JS can be a bit complex to learn initially but any software project will encouter complexity as it grows. You cannot abstract this complexity away and however you abstract your code and/or structure the complexity will simply emerge elsewhere.

That is fine.. this is normal, what react js does is forces some up front complexity in its form and structure to abstract it away later. This means the way you structure things is forced into this paradigm by its code language, syntax and thinking behind it.

What that means is that early on and while building it can feel complex or overly heavy but as things scale and different people with different style and forms of thinking grow a system.. it can grow cluttered or uintelligable without serious overheads i understanidn their way over yours.. or one teams over a mixture of another teams.

React js sets things up so that generally there is an overall theme to code proliferation through a project as it grows so you can chew through it in that paradigm. It can just feel a little muddy at first.

## React JS Hooks (First Three, Second Three, Aux Hooks)

### "First Three" Hooks

- **useState**
Use this for local data in templates, a bit ike data in vue js.. it doesn't directly translate but is similar.

- **useEffect**
Use this for clicks, actions, side effects like calling api's or pushing data out.

- **useContext**
Use this to get context data without using props to pass, handle or call data

### "Second Three" Hooks

- **useReducer**


- **useRef**


- **useMemo**
